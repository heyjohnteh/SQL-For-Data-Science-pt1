Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1.	Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM table_name;
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2.	Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.



	SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT (key))
	FROM table;

i. Business =10000
ii. Hours =1562
iii. Category =2643
iv. Attribute =1115
v. Review =10000
vi. Checkin =493
vii. Photo =10000
viii. Tip = user_id=537, business_id=3979
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years =2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: ”no”
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT * FROM user
WHERE id IS NULL OR
	Name IS NULL OR
	Review_count IS NULL OR
	Yelping_since IS NULL OR
	Useful IS NULL OR
	Funny IS NULL OR
	Cool IS NULL OR
	Fans IS NULL OR
	Average_stars IS NULL OR
	Compliment_hot IS NULL OR
	Compliment_profile IS NULL OR
	Compliment_cute IS NULL OR
	Compliment_list IS NULL OR
	Compliment_note IS NULL OR
	Compliment_plain IS NULL OR
	Compliment_cool IS NULL OR
	compliment_funny IS NULL OR
	Compliment_writer IS NULL OR
	compliment_photos IS NULL


	

	

	
3.	For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

SELECT MIN(column), MAX(column), AVG(column)
FROM table;

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:5		avg:3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:1.0		max:5.0		avg:3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:0		max:2		avg:0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:1		max:53		avg:1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:0		max:2000	avg:24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT city, SUM(review_count) AS reviews 
	FROM business
	GROUP BY City 
	ORDER BY reviews DESC;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+-------+---------+
| stars | reviews |
+-------+---------+

|   4.0 |      21 |
|   4.5 |      31 |
|   5.0 |       3 |
+-------+---------+


SQL code used to arrive at answer:

| -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg | Yuri   |         1339 |
+------------------------+--------+--------------+



8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Posting more reviews does correlate with more fans. However, more fans also correlates with time posting or how long the user has been yelping. Posting more reviews does correlate with more fans but does not certainly cause it.

SELECT id, name, review_count, fans, yelping_since
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC;

+------------------------+-----------+--------------+------+---------------------+
| id                     | name      | review_count | fans | yelping_since       |

0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	There is a strong correlation for being listed as “useful” or “funny”. The higher the counts of useful and funny the more likely that user has more fans. An exception to this would be the third reviewer “Harald”. He has the greatest number of “useful” and “funny” reviews but does not have the most fans.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
The 4-5 star group seems to have shorter hours than the 2-3 star group. This is not a great sample size (3 entries).

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes they do. One of the 4-5 star groups has a much greater number of reviews and the other 4-5 star group has a slightly greater number of reviews.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
We cannot infer anything from the location data provided between the two groups because each business is in a different zip code.

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT B.name,
			   B.review_count,
			   H.hours,
			   postal_code,
			   CASE
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
			   END AS ord,
			   CASE
				  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
				  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
			   END AS star_rating
		FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
		ON B.id = H.business_id
		INNER JOIN category C
		ON C.business_id = B.id
		WHERE (B.city == 'Las Vegas'
		AND
		C.category LIKE 'shopping')
		AND
		(B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
		OR
		B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		GROUP BY stars,ord
		ORDER BY ord,star_rating ASC
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         AVG(review_count) = 31.757
         
ii. Difference 2:
         AVG(review_count) = 23.198
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT AVG(review_count) FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1;
SELECT AVG(review_count) FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         I want to see what makes a business most successful by rating.

 
ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
