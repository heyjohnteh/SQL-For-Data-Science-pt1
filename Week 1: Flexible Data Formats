Flexible Data Formats

Exercise 1:
Goal: Write a query to format the view_item event into a table with the appropriate columns

Starter Code:
SELECT 
*
FROM 
	Dsv1069.events
WHERE
	Event_name = ‘view_item’

Solution Exercise 1:
SELECT
event_id,
event_name,
user_id,
platform,
 (CASE WHEN events.parameter_name = 'item_id'
 THEN CAST(events.parameter_value AS INT)
 ELSE NULL
 END) AS item_id
FROM dsv1069.events AS events
WHERE event_name = 'view_item'
ORDER BY event_id


Exercise 2:
Goal: Write a query to format the view_item event into a table with the appropriate columns
(This replicates what we had in the slides, but it is missing a column)

Starter Code:
SELECT
Event_id,
Event_time,
User_id,
Platform,
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘item_id’
	THEN CAST(parameter_value AS INT)
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS item_id
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE
Event_name = ‘view_item’
ORDER BY event_id

Solution Exercise 2:
SELECT
Event_id,
Event_time,
User_id,
Event_name,
Platform,
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘item_id’
	THEN CAST(parameter_value AS INT)
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS item_id
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE
Event_name = ‘view_item’
ORDER BY event_id


Exercise 3:
Goal: Use the result from the previous exercise, but make sure

Starter Code: (Ex.2)
SELECT 
Event_id,
Event_time,
User_id,
Platform,
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘item_id’
	THEN CAST(parameter_value AS INT)
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS item_id
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘referrer’
	THEN parameter_value
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS referrer
FROM
	Dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = ‘view_item’
ORDER BY event_id


Exercise 3:
Goal: Use the result from the previous exercise, but make sure

Starter Code:
SELECT 
Event_id,
Event_time,
User_id,
Platform,
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘item_id’
	THEN CAST(parameter_value AS INT)
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS item_id,
(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘referrer’
	THEN parameter_value
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS referrer
FROM
	Dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = ‘view_item’
GROUP BY
Event_id,
Event_time,
User_id,
platform


Solution Exercise 3:
SELECT 
Event_id,
Event_time,
User_id,
Platform,
MAX(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘item_id’
	THEN CAST(parameter_value AS INT)
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS item_id,
MAX(CASE WHEN parameter_name = ‘referrer’
	THEN parameter_value
	ELSE NULL
	END) AS referrer
FROM
	Dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = ‘view_item’
GROUP BY
Event_id,
Event_time,
User_id,
platform
